## Directory Descriptions

- **data/**: Contains market data files (e.g., CSVs, databases) used for training and testing models.
- **models/**: Stores trained machine learning and deep learning models, including scripts for loading and using these models.
- **strategies/**: Includes AI strategies for trading, defining how to make buy/sell decisions based on model predictions.
- **backtest/**: Contains scripts for backtesting trading strategies against historical data to evaluate performance.
- **execution/**: Holds the logic for order execution, including scripts that interact with broker APIs to place trades.
- **ui/**: Contains user interface components, potentially using Streamlit or another web framework for monitoring and interacting with the trading bot.
- **utils/**: Includes helper functions and utilities used across the project, such as data preprocessing and logging utilities.
- **main.py**: The entry point of the application, initializing the application, loading data, training models, and starting the trading process.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists the Python dependencies required for the project, including libraries for data manipulation, machine learning, and web frameworks.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd ai_trading_bot
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Prepare your market data and place it in the `data/` directory.

4. Run the application:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage Guidelines

- Modify the trading strategies in the `strategies/` directory to suit your trading preferences.
- Use the `backtest/` directory to evaluate the performance of your strategies with historical data.
- Customize the user interface in the `ui/` directory to enhance user experience.
